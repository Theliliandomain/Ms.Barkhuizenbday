<h2>Happy Birthday Ms. Barkhuizen!</h2>
<p>Dear Ms.Barkhuizen,</p>
<p>You are very good-spirited and have an ebullient, animated personality. 
If you were a colour, you would be the colour yellow because of the way you light up the room. It is also fitting, as the sun lights up the earth,
 and...would you look at that- guess whose favourite season is summer? Ms.Barkhuizen!
These were the first characteristics and impression I had of you when I first met you. 
These characteristics have proven true as the years progressed. 
You can truly be described as a "breath of fresh air" because of the authenticity you display. 
I can come across as quite an 'awkward person'; I am aware of this, and you are probably thinking right now that I may be hoodwinking you
 because I am not exactly aware of what impression you thought I had of you
 (not that it particularly holds weight) but I hope my words can convey a holistic message as clarification that cannot be described externallly-
 this is coming from what one cannot see but feel.  </br> </br>
 I have recognised that you listen to understand and are eager to ask questions to further understanding and apply knowledge and critical thinking skills. 
 "This is a characteristic trait of a genius". That is the statement that crosses my mind when I see you interacting with those around you.
 Rightfully this can parachute you to new heights in your upcoming future endeavours, and I am certain that you know this better than anyone-you are the best candidate to advocate for yourself.
 You are the only one who truly knows the power that is stored in you that can be unlocked; all the answers to your greatest life questions are within you. With this new age you may
 learn to show that enthusiasm and curious nature and critical thinking skills to unravel and unlock the capability that lies within you. </br> </br>
 Relinquish all that does not align with yourself. Remember, it is okay to say no. Revisit every circumstance and every conversation with yourself-
how you feel is most important, and it is only justified to check in with yourself before giving yourself away to other peoples opinions or expectations. </br> 
Also side note: you are very punctual and consistently look polished. Great aspects about you.</br> </br>
 Your constant dedication that has been implemented at the school has been greatly appreciated.
 I see your wonderful work, especially when you were just starting out at the school. 
 For example being able to conduct an extra mural activity such as Drama which was one of my fist encounters with your persevering characteristic. 
 I admire how you cultivated work ethic into equipping your Drama students at the time with the confidence
 to perform on stage at a formal performing arts event at the school hall. I appreciate how you worked with me to produce a fastidious monologue.
 I am extremely grateful for the hike that we went on and enjoyed the beautiful scenery.
 This year was my final year at school, and you have been an amazing mentor to guide someone on their last year. You have been very attentive and jovial.
 I thought it was wonderful that you had conducted a play this year-"Purple Pers". That is a very fulfilling task and hard work. I love to see you working on tasks that bring you closer to self-actualisation and satisfaction with yourself.
 I am very happy for you that you are now choosing a path that is aligned with your goals, 
 and I hope you have had an amazing experience from the period that you have been at the school.
 I am pretty sure you will be entering university with 10x Ninja turbo knowledge because of this experience. </br> </br>
 
 Let this be the beginning of the greatest show known to man- <b> 'Ms.Barkhuizen onto elevated heights!' </b>  </br> </br>
 I bid you a good farewell, filled with a prosperous journey ahead:)</br>
 I hope you have the most amazing birthday filled with joy and laughter!</p> </br> 
<p>Sincerely, Sibahle Mbokoma. </p>
